<-----BLACKJACK RULES----->
you start with $100 in your wallet, minimum $1 bet

**21 is blackjack, automatic win**
 
if you go over 21 then you bust, automatic loss

dealer will stay at 17 or higher unless there's a tie 

in the case of a tie, the dealer will draw another card no matter what

if neither user or dealer busts or gets blackjack, the closest to 21 wins
